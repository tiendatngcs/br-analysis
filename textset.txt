Hello, 

I see this problem on my build. I propose to fix it myself, so I create this issue

For test purposes it is desirable to inhibit an Ask for Nature by setting the don\'t ask again preference to don\'t ask again.

Unfortunately the getDontAskAgainDialogSettings and storeUserDecision methods are private.

However the DONT_ASK_AGAIN_DIALOG_PREFIX constant is public allowing a clone of getDontAskAgainDialogSettings to be written as a workaround.

Surely getDontAskAgainDialogSettings should be public?
To handle tests in module project the same as maven does (as described in bug 520713), the patch for bug 224708 automatically adds --add-reads m=ALL-UNNAMED when compiling test code in a modular project for module "m", if the classpath in not empty.

The same option should be added to the user-overridable modular runtime options from bug 525253 (but only if the option "exclude test code" introduced in Bug 529321 is not selected in the dependencies tab).

The patch should use the same logic as jdt.core to determine the modules for which this is done. To achieve that, I\'ve added the method org.eclipse.jdt.core.provisional.JavaModelAccess.determineModulesOfProjectsWithNonEmptyClasspath(JavaProject) to the patch for bug 224708

Project showing the problem

Calling organize import with a static import on a package private constant triggers a compilation error.

OrganizeImportTriggersCompileError.java:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>




<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

PackagePrivate.java:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

Public.java:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<


Runing organize import on OrganizeImportTriggersCompileError.java ends up with this code:
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>




<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

which gives a compilation error because PackagePrivate is not accessible by OrganizeImportTriggersCompileError.

Eclipse Oxygen JEE crashes on ArchLinux after clicking [Help > Marketplace]
I am on the latest I build (I20180101-2000) and use 4.7.2 for baseline and I see the following exception in the console when doing a clean build. It doesn\'t appear to affect the build results. But looking at the code, won\'t this always throw the exception?
